# Value of Information resources.

Here's some resources on [value of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_information).
Including utilities to calculate it and a card game made out of it.

## Rules
Each category (Longtermism, Animal Welfare and Global Poverty) is a "game". They are all played separately. Each game can only really be played once with any group of people (you can see why below)

You play by giving a player, or a team of players, n (I'm currently using n=8) tokens. These tokens represent money.

The goal is to create the most utility possible, by spending the money on the appropriate charities. Your utility is equal to the intervention's utility multiplied by the amount you donated to them. The interventions actual utility is printed on the underside of the intervention's card (I'm not showing you that side because otherwise people in this discord who attend my event could cheat)

On each intervention card, there is a 89% confidence interval for which the utility is likely to fall between.

Players can either put a token on an intervention to spend money on that intervention, or they can put a token on the evaluator card. The evaluator card allows you to flip over on intevention card. On the other side of the intervention card is the actual utility that comes from investing in that charity. This is, in a sense, learning about the intervention.

So the main concepts are about trading off how much money you should invest to get more information, and when you should just act on the bad information you have, what variables should influence your decision to find more information, and possibly actually doing calculations.
